# Product Marketing Skills for AI Agents

A collection of AI agent skills focused on product marketing tasks. Built for Product Marketing Managers, founders, and marketing leaders who want AI agents to help with positioning, competitive intelligence, launch planning, OKRs, experiments, and GTM strategy.

Works with Claude Code, Claude Cowork, Cursor, Windsurf, and any agent that supports the [Agent Skills spec](https://agentskills.io/).

Built by [Stefanos Karakasis](https://heystefanos.gumroad.com/).

## What This Is

Build your product marketing brain once. Every other skill reads it. No re-explaining. No copy-pasting from old chats. Sharper positioning, consistent messaging, smarter launches.

**NEW:** The system learns over time. By month 3, meta-synthesis detects patterns across all your work and updates guardrails automatically.

## See It in Action (90 Seconds)

## Start Here

Setting up your Product Marketing Context? → `/setup-context`\
Pressure-testing positioning? → `/position`\
Planning a launch? → `/plan-launch`\
Building a battlecard? → `/compete`\
Drafting a campaign brief? → `/brief`\
Detecting patterns in your work? → `/pmm-meta:synthesis`\

If this project helps you, ⭐ the repo.

## Why Product Marketing Skills?

**The problem:** Every time you ask Claude for positioning, battlecards, or briefs, you re-explain your company. By session #5, you're copy-pasting from previous chats.

**The solution:** Build your brain once (`product-marketing-context`). Every other skill reads it. Zero repetition.

The result: better positioning, sharper launches, and stronger competitive intelligence — anchored to your specific company context, not generic templates.

**Results**
- ✅ 10x faster (no re-explaining context)
- ✅ Consistent messaging (all skills read the same source)
- ✅ Compound intelligence (skills reference each other's outputs)
- ✅ **System learns over time** — meta-synthesis detects patterns across all your work and updates guardrails monthly

## How It Works: Skills, Commands, and the Compounding Loop

### Skills & Commands

**Skills** are the building blocks of the marketplace. Each skill gives Claude domain knowledge, analytical frameworks, or a guided workflow for a specific PMM task.

**Commands** are user-triggered workflows invoked with `/command-name`. They chain one or more skills into an end-to-end process.

**Plugins** group related skills and commands into installable packages covering specific GTM domains.

### The Compounding Loop (NEW)

This system isn't just a collection of tools—it's a **self-improving operating system**. Every execution teaches the system. By month 3, it knows more about your GTM than you do.

```
Month 1: Baseline
└─ Run execution skills (experiments, retros, OKRs, interviews)
   └─ Each skill logs session data to /context/skill-sessions.md
      └─ System collects patterns
         └─ Monthly meta-synthesis runs
            └─ Detects patterns (2+ occurrences = guardrail)
               └─ Proposes guardrails + brain updates
                  └─ You approve/reject via gates

Month 2: Compound
└─ Run execution skills again
   └─ Each skill loads guardrails from meta-synthesis at pre-flight (Step 0)
      └─ Inputs are smarter (guided by prior learnings)
         └─ Outputs are higher quality
            └─ Meta-synthesis detects new patterns
               └─ Guardrails + brain update again
                  └─ System gets smarter

Month 3+: Exponential
└─ Every execution is informed by every prior execution
   └─ System knows your GTM blindspots
      └─ System knows what risks to watch
         └─ System knows your confidence calibration
            └─ System makes better decisions than you could manually
```

**What gets stored and reused:**

- `/context/skill-sessions.md` — Master log of all skill executions (logs from experiment-doc, interview-summary, retro, pmm-okrs, pre-mortem, prd, prioritization, stakeholder-maps)
- `/context/meta-patterns.md` — Master guardrails file (written by meta-synthesis, read by all execution skills at pre-flight)
- `/foundation/brain.md` Sections 2, 5, 7 — Updated by meta-synthesis with learnings (anti-ICP signals, revenue lever adjustments, system patterns)

**Core monthly workflow:**

1. Run execution skills throughout the month (30+ days of data)
2. End of month: run `/pmm-meta:synthesis`
3. Meta-synthesis detects patterns, proposes guardrails + brain updates
4. You approve/reject via approval gates
5. Next month: execution skills load updated guardrails → outputs are smarter
6. Repeat. System compounds.

## How Skills Work Together

Your skills cascade. Each reads your brain (the shared context layer), produces output, and stores learnings. The next skill is smarter because it inherited context from the last one.

Skills reference each other and build on shared context. The `product-marketing-context` skill is the foundation — every other skill checks it first to understand your product, ICP, personas, positioning, and competitive landscape before doing anything.

```

Commands use skills. Some skills serve multiple commands. Some skills (like `prioritization-frameworks` or `proof-points-claims`) are standalone references that Claude draws on whenever relevant — no command needed.

Commands are designed to flow into each other, matching the PMM workflow. After any command completes, it suggests relevant next commands — just follow the prompts.

## Installation

Pick any method below. All work with Claude Code CLI, Cursor, Cowork, and Windsurf.

### Option 1: CLI Install (Recommended)

Use [npx skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) to install skills directly:

```bash
# Install all skills
npx skills add stefanoskarakasis/Product-Marketing-Skills

# Install specific skills
npx skills add stefanoskarakasis/Product-Marketing-Skills --skill positioning-messaging experiment-doc

# List available skills
npx skills add stefanoskarakasis/Product-Marketing-Skills --list
```

This automatically installs to your `.agents/skills/` directory (and symlinks into `.claude/skills/` for Claude Code compatibility).

### Option 2: Claude Cowork Plugin

Install via Claude Cowork's built-in plugin system:

```bash
# Add the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add stefanoskarakasis/Product-Marketing-Skills

# Install all PMM skills
/plugin install pmm-skills
```

### Option 3: Clone and Copy

Clone the entire repo and copy the skills folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stefanoskarakasis/Product-Marketing-Skills.git
cp -r Product-Marketing-Skills/skills/* .agents/skills/
```

### Option 4: Git Submodule

Add as a submodule for easy updates:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/stefanoskarakasis/Product-Marketing-Skills.git .agents/pmm-skills
```

Then reference skills from `.agents/pmm-skills/skills/`.

### Option 5: Fork and Customize

1. Fork this repository
2. Customize skills for your specific PMM needs
3. Clone your fork into your projects

### Option 6: SkillKit (Multi-Agent)

Use [SkillKit](https://github.com/rohitg00/skillkit) to install skills across multiple AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, etc.):

```bash
# Install all skills
npx skillkit install stefanoskarakasis/Product-Marketing-Skills

# Install specific skills
npx skillkit install stefanoskarakasis/Product-Marketing-Skills --skill positioning-messaging experiment-doc

# List available skills
npx skillkit install stefanoskarakasis/Product-Marketing-Skills --list
```

## Usage

Once installed, just ask your agent to help with PMM tasks:

```
"Help me plan a product launch for SSO integration"
→ Uses go-to-market-strategy skill

"Generate positioning for our platform"
→ Uses positioning-messaging skill

"Build a competitive battlecard for Okta"
→ Uses competitive-battlecard skill

"Run Q3 quarterly PMM cycle"
→ Uses workflow-orchestrator skill

"Create a GACCS campaign brief"
→ Uses gaccs-brief skill

"Run meta-synthesis to detect patterns"
→ Reads all execution logs, proposes guardrails + brain updates
```

You can also invoke skills directly with commands:

```
"Run full launch workflow for [product]"
/workflow-orchestrator

"What tier is this feature?"
/go-to-market-strategy

"Build positioning for B2B SaaS"
/positioning-messaging 

"Run retrospective for last launch"
/retro 

"Generate Q4 OKRs"
/pmm-okrs 

"Run monthly meta-synthesis"
/pmm-meta:synthesis
```

Skills read your brain automatically — zero context re-explaining.

### How Logging Works (NEW):

Every execution skill logs session data automatically:

```yaml
skill: retro
session_date: 2026-06-21
quality_score: 78
guardrails_triggered: 2
risks_materialized: 2
pre_mortem_accuracy: 67%
brain_updates_proposed: 1
```

This data feeds into meta-synthesis, which detects patterns:
- "Pre-mortem accuracy is 67% → let's refine the process"
- "Champion alignment gap appeared 4 times → add to guardrails"
- "Post-sales prep underestimated twice → give users more time"

Each pattern becomes a guardrail that next month's skills load at pre-flight (Step 0).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>5. pmm-meta</strong> — **NEW** Self-improving system: meta-synthesis, meta-learn, meta-review, meta-verify (4 skills, 8 commands)</summary>

**The meta layer that makes your entire system self-improving.** Reads execution logs, detects patterns, proposes guardrails and brain updates, gates approval before write.

### Skills (4):

- **meta-synthesis** (v1.0.0) — Monthly pattern detection across all execution skills. Reads `/context/skill-sessions.md`, detects cross-skill patterns (2+ domains = HIGH), proposes guardrails and brain updates, outputs to `/context/meta-patterns.md`. The beating heart of the system.
- **meta-learn** — Captures post-session learnings and routes them to knowledge base.
- **meta-review** — Audits any skill against SKILL-SPEC v2.0.0 (19-point checklist).
- **meta-verify** — Quality gate on T1 skill output before delivery.

### Commands (8):

- `/pmm-meta:synthesis` — Run meta-synthesis monthly. Detects patterns, proposes guardrails + brain updates, gates approval.
- `/pmm-meta:synthesis-status` — Show current meta-synthesis state (patterns, guardrails active/stale, updates proposed/approved).
- `/pmm-meta:learn` — Capture learnings from last execution skill session.
- `/pmm-meta:learn-history` — Show patterns captured in knowledge base (searchable).
- `/pmm-meta:learn-promote [pattern]` — Promote pattern from "watch" to "active guardrail."
- `/pmm-meta:review [skill]` — Audit skill against SKILL-SPEC (19-point checklist).
- `/pmm-meta:review-all` — Batch review all skills in pmm-meta folder.
- `/pmm-meta:verify [output]` — Quality check on T1 output before ship.

### Examples:

**Skills:**
- `Run meta-synthesis for June` → Detects patterns, proposes guardrails
- `Show synthesis status` → What patterns? Which guardrails active? Which proposals pending?
- `Capture learnings from today's retro`
- `Review experiment-doc skill against spec`
- `Quality check: is this positioning brief ready to ship?`

**Commands:**
- `/pmm-meta:synthesis` — End of June
- `/pmm-meta:synthesis-status` — Check state before approving guardrail proposals
- `/pmm-meta:verify [positioning brief]` — Before sharing with CEO

### How It Works:

**Monthly loop:**
1. Run execution skills throughout the month (30+ days of data)
2. End of month: `/pmm-meta:synthesis`
3. Meta-synthesis reads `/context/skill-sessions.md`, detects patterns
4. Proposes guardrails + brain updates with approval gates
5. You approve/reject
6. Next month: execution skills load updated guardrails at Step 0
7. System is smarter. Repeat.

**By month 3:** System compounds automatically. Every execution is informed by every prior execution.

- **go-to-market-strategy** — Assigns launch tier (T1-T4), generates strategic briefs with messaging and channels, self-learns from past launches
- **workflow-orchestrator** — Chains 20+ hs- skills for complete GTM programs. Covers 10 workflows: full launch, positioning refresh, competitive program, quarterly PMM cycle, market entry, post-launch retro, competitive response, ICP foundation, voice foundation, and new hire onboarding

### Commands (2):

- `/pmm-go-to-market:launch-strategy` — Assign tier and generate GTM strategy for product/feature launch
- `/pmm-go-to-market:run-workflow` — Run complete multi-skill GTM workflow (launch, quarterly, competitive, etc.)

### Examples:

**Skills:**
- `We're launching SSO integration. What tier is this?`
- `Run full launch workflow for analytics dashboard`
- `Run Q3 PMM cycle — refresh all assets`
- `Competitive program for top 3 competitors`
- `We're entering the healthcare vertical — run market entry workflow`
- `Run retro for our last launch and update brain`

**Commands:**
- `/pmm-go-to-market:launch-strategy` — SSO integration launch
- `/pmm-go-to-market:run-workflow` — Full launch workflow for [product], DRI: me
- `/pmm-go-to-market:run-workflow` — Quarterly PMM cycle, goal: refresh all core assets

### Supported Workflows (10):

1. **Full Product Launch** — positioning → competitive → strategy → campaign → stakeholder → retro (6-12 weeks)
2. **Positioning Refresh** — positioning → value props → update battlecards (1-2 weeks)
3. **Competitive Intelligence Program** — alternatives → battlecards → CI briefing (2-4 weeks)
4. **Quarterly PMM Cycle** — retro → positioning audit → competitive refresh → OKRs (3-4 weeks)
5. **New Market Entry** — ICP → personas → positioning → competitive → strategy (8-12 weeks)
6. **Post-Launch Retro** — retro → update brain with actuals (1 week)
7. **Competitive Response** — fast battlecard → value props → sales assets (1-2 weeks)
8. **ICP + Personas Foundation** — ICP → personas → interviews (2-3 weeks)
9. **Voice & Tone Foundation** — voice guide → test with writing-assistant (1 week)
10. **Full PMM Onboarding** — audit brain → gap report (1-2 weeks, read-only)

### What Makes This Different:

**Self-learning:** Reads brain Section 7 (launch history) and adjusts recommendations based on YOUR past performance, not generic best practices.

**Brain-integrated:** Pulls positioning (Section 3), ICP (Section 2), competitive intel (Section 4), proof points (Section 5) — or flags gaps.

**Multi-skill orchestration:** One prompt chains positioning → competitive → strategy → campaign → stakeholder → execution. No manual routing.

**Writes back to brain:** Updates Sections 3, 4, 5, 7 automatically after each workflow. Fifth launch is smarter than first.

**Master program documents:** Produces complete program docs with artifacts, coherence reports, open questions, and next steps.
